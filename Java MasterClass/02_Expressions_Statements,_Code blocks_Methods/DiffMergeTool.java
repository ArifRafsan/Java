//Diff Merge tool
/*
    1. DiffMerge is an program that will help you to visually compare and merge files on any operating system.
    2. It can be very helpful with programming as well.
    3. Some other tools like code repositories use similar merge operations, so this will also help you in the future
       when you start working with code repositories.
    4. When you code along with the videos in course it is easy to make a typo, and get stuck, and this is wherer            DiffMerge will help you.
    5. Every lesson has the code attached to it that I typed in the video and you can download a zip file with all that      code.
